> My password is password but it is `2_*_10_*_16_*_8_*_4` characters long. Whats my password ? Ha ha ha!

## Write-up

The answer was the MD5 hash of the string `password`, i.e.:

```bash
$ md5 -s password
MD5 ("password") = 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
```

Explanation:

* `2*4 = 8` = number of bytes in the string `password`
* `10*16-8*2 = 128` = number of bits in an MD5 hash
* `4*8 = 32 = 16*2` = number of bytes in the hexadecimal representation of an MD5 hash
