# Volga Quals CTF 2014: Admin 500

**Points:** 500
**Description:**

> At the dawn of mars colonization corporate wars were extremely common.
> Best technologies mankind ever made were turned into thousands of new ways to kill.
> Every single corporate war were a real bloody hell and 80% of corporate mercenaries were dead in two to three weeks.
> That's not straight the point of this task. There is a legend being told about engeneering squad sergeant who didn't wanted to just disappear. So, few minutes before he was burnt by napalm strike he was able to attach personal distress beacon to the nearby high power radio-relay tower, record and set some random destination route trom inside the radiorelay network in hope that he who finds message will report srgt's death to HQ.
> Legend says that beacon is still functional and dead srgt's message is circulating in radio relay network for decades without being noticed.
> We know the destination net of the message, however land around the destination tower is highly radioactive, so no live being is able to approach. There is a service terminal allowing to connect your equipment to destination tower and one of beacon-facing towers channels via high power radio, with shitty channel quality however. Towers are using ancient and vulnerable as hell routing protocols. We believe that with your skills you'll be able to reroute dead man's message and recover his personal id number thus he wouldn't be forgotten.
> This personal id is a key for the task. Beacon message destination is 10.x%@.200.0/29.
> Good luck.
