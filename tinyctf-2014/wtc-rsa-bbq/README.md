## Write-up

Let’s extract [the provided `cry200.zip` file](cry200.zip):

```bash
$ unzip cry200.zip
Archive:  cry200.zip
  inflating: cry200
```

The extracted `cry200` file is another ZIP file:

```bash
$ file cry200
cry200: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract
```

So let’s extract it as well:

```bash
$ unzip cry200
Archive:  cry200
  inflating: cipher.bin
  inflating: key.pem
```

This is an RSA task, so let’s try to break the public key first. The task title contains a big hint: WTC refers to the Twin Towers, which is a hint at [twin primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime).

Let’s extract the modulus and exponent from the public key first.

```bash
$ openssl rsa -in key.pem -pubin -text -noout
Public-Key: (8587 bit)
Modulus:

This already looks very fishy. Those `\xff` bytes show that the modulus is very close to a power of 2, multiplied by some number. Factoring this number would be impossible if we started from the beginning, but we can find the square root of the number and start from there. The following script does just that:

```python
def isqrt(n):
  x = n
  y = (x + n // x) // 2
  while y < x:
    x = y
    y = (x + n // x) // 2
  return x

n = 67957992944541709079637331495835288051017736172946219268979124310219676901814634141994056910249665182493729973853745613557654443204907939100289830019879722192443748372464385547701814777428863933615522890059773474417386931884425569247554583568455670977507333610910984675277207738543785144821532814109666026143830882670492412501367418900259525020329476259602896533289977520877332000639367622359213599508853567838502735818733930199768810238363613613753812700686852922490193705926713608040249887743216661319134457665231243871456616938275370046526015614319970725259025037328092187037543179610573655207460380491069632574369131778109901652462838149658009709174356861767870204803806924289315954871595222073859185353284268587331267173728221658781990119401252167899826047588583247362298572788397512447184590473718761927222549389515152849248566281272354480116085470203137413924993107429630882329043259530840382880179158766903387472716587067982240678129096467201138461960380680792953534366991098348930562736587887507018304132204828793333486018470656056870548645765390879310100168147762901154890481163444481122296433539288905754638768700952492512406731460604412447424967642115057341729310735982961515248311488333222612609961196477124084039771246638999119951171033639602489932159455170406551791127198312487436473494597495007637073871513066738388720194946877125132719068351961085662002556667562192631487439603084021927891681500086528284664252971146275389474911554158614058033716200975019522317823518017673425098559715637356338155079086810436188632405309750833509905138561418180066417475648209078560221064551872389391920606516486209161430247427717376721027499023891011742164463421915449354247944433039198608877315066424065203739793333831943021283319660097829517280179002430376294322395829290502762707146363340431306946572116838111246133390539315819023086956548363452657425340012155573512351731935196011505710069798425307656340650313899667019621505845424588367900827398564048322933092059258373872118350187669748998950161402077367239291462315563970921983573721268515566367155707585109243757143789901450148994239501684623655163637997105769222959494325064113278738038394139099703042640054592379346782002980751786063951491138135071807202634411442713870047730189971333170418112077390015852729766594918955255488280027359348811304774349052504612270369695008061623968574970758347117606577939555446238067430685787886502742201372798852010893885999941946548336103402517187248492765699490151394806591149028320530966365733320484047650429644420042692902092613911608152310152409036167526533619822851411589502970363903
e = 65537

i = isqrt(n)

p, q = 0, 0

while True:
  if n - (i * (n / i)) == 0:
    p = i
    q = n/i
    break
  i += 1

print p
print q
```

This gives us `p` and `q`, which are indeed twin primes. All we have to do now is to decrypt `cipher.bin`.
We can achieve this with the following script:

```python

print ('%x' % flag).decode('hex')
```

After executing this, we get the flag in the output:

```
Congratulations! Here is a treat for you: flag{how_d0_you_7urn_this_0n?}
