**Category:** Network
**Points:** 200
**Author:** Vlad Roskov (vos)
**Description:**

> There was a nice [Christmas release from Evad3rs](http://evasi0n.com/) to jailbreak iOS 7, but it doesn't handle my Apple TV 3G!
> Develop an Apple TV jailbreak real quick, and prove filesystem access by showing me any internal system binary from the latest firmware.
>
> Send as attachment to net200@ctf.su
> (and allow some time for manual check)
