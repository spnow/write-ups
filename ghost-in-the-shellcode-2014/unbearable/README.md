# Ghost in the Shellcode 2014: Unbearable

**Category:** Choose your Pwn Adventure 2
**Points:** 75
**Description:**

> Challenge available from within PwnAdventure2.

## Write-up

The challenge was to open a chest located in an area full of dangerous bears. To make things worse, cracking the chest takes five full minutes, during which the bears start shooting at you with machine guns.

When you drink _Wine_ in Choose Your Pwn Adventure 2, you get a slight damage resistance boost. To solve this challenge, hack this modifier to make you completely invulnerable instead. This allows you to get past the many dangerous machine-gun-armed bears.

(TODO)

The flag is `The Drunken Master can bear any trial`.
