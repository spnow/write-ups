# Ghost in the Shellcode 2014: Moon Boots

> Challenge available from within PwnAdventure2.

## Write-up

The challenge was to enter the Moon level somehow.

This can be done in several ways:

1. by hacking the gravity modifier, changing it from `-9.81` to, say, `0.5`
2. by hacking the initial jump velocity modifier, changing it to a value higher than `25`

That way, itâ€™s possible to jump out of bounds on the regular map, which effectively teleports you to the moon.

The flag is `Use a Tab, Space will leave you breathless`.
