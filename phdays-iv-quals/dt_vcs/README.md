**Points:** 3800
**Description:**

> We found [Detcelfer's Version Control System](http://195.133.87.174). I never would have guessed that lots of hackers around the world makes him stronger. It seems like Achilles' heel place for Detcelfer. Find the way to delete all the soruce code and stop his development.
