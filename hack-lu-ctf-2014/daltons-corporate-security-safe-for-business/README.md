# Hack.lu CTF 2014: Dalton’s Corporate Security Safe for Business

**Category:** Web
**Points:** 200
**Author:** freddy
**Description:**

> The Dalton Brothers are tricking people into buying their “safe” locks. So they can rob them afterwards. The lock has some safety features, as it resets itself after a few seconds. It also requires a lot of valid inputs before it’s letting you open it. Please find out what their weakness is and report back.
