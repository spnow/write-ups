**Description:**

> After a long day, you sit around a campfire in the wild wild web with a few Sioux you met today. To celebrate friendship one of them takes out his wooden peace pipe and minutes later everyone seems to be pretty dizzy. You remember that their war chief “Makawee” started something to say about a secret tipi filled with fire-water (the good stuff). But when he noticed your interest he immediately stopped talking. You recall that “Makawee” spoke with “Wahkoowah” about that issue, but it ended with a fight. Since then Makawee wouldn’t talk to Wahkoowah anymore. While they argued “Chapawee” wrote something down. Maybe you can exploit their dizzyness to find out the location of the tipi.
