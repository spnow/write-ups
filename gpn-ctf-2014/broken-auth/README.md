# GPN CTF 2014 - Broken auth

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 200
**Description:**

> Alice and Bernd are using a service to talk about some secret stuff. I'd like to know what they are talking about, but they're using PGP. They placed their public keys on a website and even bragged about the secure scheme they constructed just to keep me out :-( 

> Alice: endpoint [ctf.gpn.entropia.de:50200](ctf.gpn.entropia.de:50200), [alice-key](alice_5487b432da0050fd34dbd3f7cd3b3006.asc)

> Bernd: endpoint [ctf.gpn.entropia.de:50201](ctf.gpn.entropia.de:50200), [bernd-key](bernd_a4a0278e085a0bde2a71a1f35ba787ee.asc)

> Scheme: [scheme.txt](scheme_4484e425e364d68090d498677975ff91.txt)

> Can you figure out what they are talking about?
