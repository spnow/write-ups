## Write-up

After looking for those words and 'win' in Google we came up with Wikipedia page (this is the only one that is connected with IT/Security) about [NIST hash function competition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_hash_function_competition).
The purpose of this cometition was to develop a [SHA-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) to complement SHA-1 and SHA-2 hashing algorithms.

Cheetah, Lane and Tangle were all entrants to the competition though they did not qualify for the final round. The winner was [Keccak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keccak) thus the flag for this challenge is Keccak.
