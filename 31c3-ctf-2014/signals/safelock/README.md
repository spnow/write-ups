**Category:** signals
**Points:** 20
**Solves:** 2
**Description:**

> This is the circuit of a safe lock. Get the key to open it! <http://188.40.18.86/safelock/>
> Itâ€™s neither about webtronics nor ngspice. Disregard bugs in both.
> If you want to write spice code directly, use something like this:
>
> ```bash
> cat test.cir | curl --data-binary '@-' http://188.40.18.86/safelock/contest_spice/spice.cgi
> ```
>
> **Hints:**
>
> - when you hand-build your SPICE code: keep in mind that the first line is special and should be a comment, otherwise it is ignored.
> - The web interface does fully work with Chrome. Use Firefox.
