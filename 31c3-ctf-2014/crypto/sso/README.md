## Write-up

_By HoLyVieR_

The encryption used was done character by character, and we could decrypt any token of our choice with the `info.php` page. With this in mind, we could bruteforce each character individually until we get the character of our choice once decrypted. This would then let us craft a token with the value of our choice. Hereâ€™s an example of a decrypted token that worked:

```
{"User":"admin","Admin":1}
```

Code:

```python
import httplib

target = '{"User":"admin","Admin":1}'
conn = httplib.HTTPConnection('188.40.18.87:5144')

def getvalue(token):
	conn.request('GET', 'http://188.40.18.87:5144/info.php?token=%s' % (token), '')
	return conn.getresponse().read()

# We get this part of the token by simply using a token generated for any user
token = '69222e97316b9dd8f7'

for j in range(len(token) / 2, len(target)):
	for i in range(256):
		h = hex(i)[2:]
		if len(h) == 1:
			h = '0' + h

		r = getvalue(token + h)

		if r == target[:len(r)]:
			token += h
			break

	print(token)
```

Then we had to visit `http://188.40.18.87:5144/admin.php?token=INSERT_TOKEN_HERE`.
