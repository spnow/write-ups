## Write-up

The intended solution was to find [this OkCupid profile](http://www.okcupid.com/profile/TheJulianCohen), which displays the flag `julian_will_not_date_you_sorry`.

During the CTF, a troll [set up another OkCupid profile that was much easier to find](http://www.okcupid.com/profile/hockeyinjune) whose ‘self-summary’ is as follows:

> `flag{flowers_and_wine_will_get_me}`

The CTF organisers counter-trolled by accepting that flag (`flowers_and_wine_will_get_me`) as well.
