# Plaid CTF 2014: wheeeee

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 375
**Description:**

> Although it seems like The Plague's messaging service is secure, there are bound to be bugs in any 20th century crypto system. We've recovered [a version](wheeeee-8aa05f8827f5ece6a27c021eae46d118.tar.bz2) of the block cipher The Plague implemented. Use their online encryptor tool, at 54.82.75.29:8193, to break the cipher and figure out Plague's secret plans.
>
> NOTE: When the service sends you a hex-encoded string, respond with a hex-encoded string.
