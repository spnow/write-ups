# Plaid CTF 2014: Freya

**Category:** Misc
**Points:** 250
**Description:**

> We've traveled back far, but this protocol looks familiar... Our reconnaissance team did a great job, they got us [a data capture from the currently running systems and a private key](freya-378469981a7016d6179a844fffe2a82b.tar.bz2) from the server (shell.woo.pctf which resolves to 54.226.73.167). Take a look at the traffic our reconnaissance team picked up, and see if you can get access to The Plague's server, at 54.226.73.167.
