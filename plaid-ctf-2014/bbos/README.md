# Plaid CTF 2014: bbos

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 100
**Description:**

> You have traveled back in time, but look, hunting The Plague is tough. You're really just going back to relax for a while without having to worry about all that nonsense. As you walk in the park you stumble across someone's BlackBerry. Wow, people still use BlackBerry phones (time travel gets so confusing)? You figure you should return it to the owner, but you have a hard time getting inside. Figure out what's on [the phone](https://mega.co.nz/#!ulIEhCpQ!FlmQ9o4y_msfk3hUzqIw6vFGzrfVFWUQGqJRRJlrzfI), and maybe we'll be able to return it to the rightful owner.
