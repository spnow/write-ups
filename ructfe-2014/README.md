## Info

RuCTFE is an annual online international challenge in information security. It has been held 5 times already.

The contest is driven by classic rules. Each team is given a set of vulnerable services. Organizers regulary fill services with private information â€” the flags. The goal of each team is to find vulnerabilities, fix them in their services and exploit them in order to get flags from other teams. Please refer to [the rules page](http://ructf.org/e/2014/rules) for slightly more info.

All flags match this regular expression: `/^\w{31}=$/`.
