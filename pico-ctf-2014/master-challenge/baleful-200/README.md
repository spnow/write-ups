# Pico CTF 2014 : Baleful

**Category:** Master Challenge
**Points:** 200
**Description:**

>This program seems to be rather delightfully twisted! Can you get it to accept a password? We need it to get access to some Daedalus Corp files.

**Hint:**
>This program appears to be "packed." Fortunately, it's packed with a common packer, and no trickery was performed - so you should be able to just unpack it with the same packer.
