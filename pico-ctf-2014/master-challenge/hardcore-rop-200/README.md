# Pico CTF 2014 : Hardcore ROP

**Category:** Master Challenge
**Points:** 200
**Description:**

>This program is obviously broken, but thanks to ASLR, PIE, and NX it's still pretty secure! Right?
NB: This problem is running in a slightly unusual setup to get extra PIE randomness. If you have an exploit that works 100% reliably locally (outside of GDB, which often disables any randomness), but you can't get it to land on our server, feel free to message us for help.

**Hint:**
>This is a statically linked binary (using musl libc). There is no full libc available for you to return into, but if you can leak a .text section address you can return into main(), randop(), and the chunks of libc that are included. Also, you'll probably need to hunt for ROP gadgets: here is a nice tool for that.
