# Pico CTF 2014 : RSA Mistakes

**Category:** Master Challenge
**Points:** 200
**Description:**

>Daedalus Corp seems to have had a very weird way of broadcasting some secret data. We managed to find the server code that broadcasted it, and one of our routers caught some of their traffic - can you find the secret data? We think someone may have requested the secret using someone else's user id by accident, but we're not sure.

**Hint:**
>Two of these messages use the same public key, and are related in a useful way.
