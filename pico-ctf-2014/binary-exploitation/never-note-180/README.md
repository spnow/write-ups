# Pico CTF 2014 : Never note

**Category:** Binary Exploitation
**Points:** 180
**Description:**

>In light of the recent attacks on their machines, Daedalus Corp has implemented a buffer overflow detection library. Nevernote, a program made for Daedalus Corps employees to take notes, uses this library.
Can you bypass their protection and read the secret? The binary can be found at /home/nevernote/ on the shell server.

The source can be downloaded here.

**Hint:**
>Think about what fields of the canary struct you control. Also, malloc() is predictable without ASLR.
