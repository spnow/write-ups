# Pico CTF 2014 : What the Flag

**Category:** Binary Exploitation
**Points:** 140
**Description:**

>This binary uses stack cookies to prevent exploitation, but all hope is not lost. Read the flag from flag.txt anyways! The binary can be found at /home/what_the_flag/ on the shell server. You can solve this problem interactively [here](https://picoctf.com/problem-static/binary/WhatTheFlag/what_the_flag.html
). The source can be found [here](what_the_flag.c).

**Hint:**
>How can you enter a correct password, but still overflow the buffer? Think about what terminates gets(). Also, the file name that you want to open is already in the binary!
