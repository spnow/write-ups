# Pico CTF 2014 : Common Vulnerability Exercise

**Category:** Miscellaneous
**Points:** 20
**Description:**

>This disc is encrypted. The surprisingly elaborate password hint refers to "the [CVE Identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures) for a 2014 vulnerability that allowed arbitrary code execution in Firefox via a buffer overflow in a speech codec". If you found this "CVE-ID" thingy, it'd probably be the password.

**Hint:**
>You can search CVEs at [Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cve.html). Google is pretty good at searching things too ;)
