# Pico CTF 2014 : Massive Fail

**Category:** Web Exploitation
**Points:** 120
**Description:**

>Fed up with their recent PHP related issues, Daedalus Corp. has switched their website to run on Ruby on Rails (version 3.1.0) instead. Their brand new registration page does not seem like much of an improvement though... [Source](http://web2014.picoctf.com:5000/user/register).

**Hint:**
>The source code files app/controllers/user_controller.rb and db/schema.rb are particularly interesting.
