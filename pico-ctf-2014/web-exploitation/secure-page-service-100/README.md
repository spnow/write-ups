# Pico CTF 2014 : Secure Page service 

**Category:** Web Exploitation
**Points:** 100
**Description:**

>The bad guys have hidden their access codes on an anonymous secure page service. Our intelligence tells us that the codes was posted on a page with id 43440b22864b30a0098f034eaf940730ca211a55, but unfortunately it's protected by a password, and only site moderators can view the post without the password. Can you help us recover the codes?

**Hint:**
>What happens if you put HTML into a page?
