# Pico CTF 2014 : Grep is still your friend

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 40
**Description:**

>The police need help decrypting one of your father's files. Fortunately you know where he wrote down all his backup decryption keys as a backup (probably not the best security practice). You are looking for the key corresponding to daedaluscorp.txt.enc. The file is stored on the shell server at /problems/grepfriend/keys .

**Hint:**
>[Grep](http://www.uccs.edu/~ahitchco/grep/) is your friend!
