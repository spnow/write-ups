# Pico CTF 2014 : SSH Backdoor

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 100
**Description:**

>Some hackers have broken into my server backdoor.picoctf.com and locked my user out (my username is jon). I need to retrieve the flag.txt file from my home directory.
The last thing we noticed in out network logs show is the attacker downloading this. Can you figure out a way to get back into my account?

**Hint:**
>The attackers left a backdoor in the openssh server. Maybe you could compare it to the real code?
