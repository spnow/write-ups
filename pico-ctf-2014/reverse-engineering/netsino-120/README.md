# Pico CTF 2014 : Netsino

**Category:** Reverse
**Points:** 120
**Description:**

>Daedalus seems to have ties to a shady online gambling boss. Maybe if you beat him at his own game, you can persuade him to share some useful info. The server is running on vuln2014.picoctf.com:4547 and the source code can be found here.

**Hint:**
>You can't always win at gambling. But if you can reverse this program and find the bug, you'll find that making money may not be so hard after all.
