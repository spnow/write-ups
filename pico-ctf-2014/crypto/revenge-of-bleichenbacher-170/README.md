# Pico CTF 2014 : Revenge of the Bleichenbacher

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 170
**Description:**

>We found a Daedalus Corp command server, that lets people read some shared files. But it requires cryptographically signed commands! Can you forge a signature for us? It's running at vuln2014.picoctf.com. The JAR file for the service is here.

**Hint:**
>The service's signature checks are incomplete: can you figure out a way to put in some garbage? In particular, we think it may be vulnerable to a similar bug that Mozilla's NSS library was recently: see here.
