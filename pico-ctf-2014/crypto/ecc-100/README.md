# Pico CTF 2014 : ECC

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 100
**Description:**

>We found a weird piece of paper with this written on it. I can't make heads or tails of it, but it seems to be talking about an encoded message. Can you get the message for us?

**Hint:**
>Use a computer algebra system with builtin support for elliptic curves, such as Sage. This elliptic curve is defined over the group of integers Z/nZ (Zmod(n) in Sage) and is in Weierstrass form (a1 = a2 = a3 = 0).
