# Pico CTF 2014 : RSA

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 80
**Description:**

>A Daedalus Corp spy sent an RSA-encrypted message. We got their key data, but we're not very good at math. Can you decrypt it? Here's the data. Note that the flag is not a number but a number decoded as ASCII text.

**Hint:**
>This is just plain old RSA decryption.
